Why scripting?
Command line, automation, build system, templating, code istribution, formulae, bussines rules, smart configuration,
product lines, dsl, self-modifying code.

Scripting characteristics
interpreted, not compiled ( in principle) //we get source code.
Lenient type system
"Best effort" approach

function plotter: eval
eval() works as if the code was copied verbatim
example: Eval("1+1")
const code = "1" ; eval(code+"+1");

function() is like eval() but declares 
parameters and executes in the global
scope. it creates a reference.
const add = Function('x','y', 'return x+y'); //
add(1,2);
add(2,3); // no need to re-parse

What scripting is used for:
Content source code, auto evualate 
*Test automation.
*Self-modifying CODE. 
*Distributing code for execution on other machines
*Dynamic business rules
