Become aware what you do 
We program collaboratively and look for moves

Task1: improve the tests

More Structure
Better reports when tests fail 

Moves your choice
what conuts is your moves, not mine
There are signal -reaction schemes 
try to have multiple options 

0: Explore
Technical feasibility, hypotheses, border cases
the goal is to learn and verify, delete when finished 
give yourself a timebox 

1: Start at the end
Make static "sketch" of the result before adding dynamic features (FITYMI)
1 b) dynamic sketches,
e.g all JS, css in a single html file 
2: Extract
Replace static 


3: Abstract  
discover the concept behind what you 
have extracted. give it a name
It should work for itself and in combination
revert if you cannot find one 
4: Reorganize
Organize and re-feactor to make your future work easier
facilitate extensions or improvements 
prepare for release 

5:

6: Retrospective 
what to keep? 
what to try differently next time 

Observations
Balance and distance 
which technologies support my moves: 
dynamic exploration, refactoring 
Per feature , per project, whole career,...

Work at home 
Adapt all existing test cases to the new testing api 
extend or improve the todo-list example to your liking
